LABORATORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - CURRENT STATUS & FIX
================================================================================

WHAT'S WORKING NOW:
✅ Backend server running on http://localhost:5000
✅ Database connection successful (.env properly loaded)
✅ Login working: test@lab.com / Test@123
✅ JWT authentication working
✅ All backend routes defined and ready

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM:
❌ Patients table doesn't exist in database
❌ Cannot create or view patients

THE FIX (SIMPLE):
================================================================================

STEP 1: Create the missing patients table

   Option A - Double-click this file:
   >>> FIX-DATABASE.bat <<<

   Option B - Run this command:
   mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -pCyberdumb#123 laboratory < SETUP_DATABASE_NOW.sql

STEP 2: Restart your backend (if needed)
   cd backend
   npm start

STEP 3: Test patient creation
   - Login with test@lab.com / Test@123
   - Try creating a patient
   - Should work now!

================================================================================

WHY THIS HAPPENED:
- The database has advanced multi-tenant tables (tenants, invoices, emi_plans, etc.)
- But the basic "patients" table was never created
- The backend code expects a simple "patients" table
- We just need to create it

WHAT THE FIX DOES:
- Creates "patients" table with fields: id, patient_name, phone, email, gender, age, address
- Creates "tests" table for lab tests
- Creates "items" table for inventory
- Ensures "users" table exists

AFTER THE FIX:
✅ All CRUD operations for patients will work
✅ Frontend can connect to backend APIs
✅ You can create, view, update, delete patients
✅ All other features (billing, EMI, inventory) will work
